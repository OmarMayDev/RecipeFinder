# Recipe Finder

## Project Overview

The **Recipe Finder** is a web application that showcases my proficiency in **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. The app allows users to search for any food dish and provides a list of relevant recipes. Users can then select a recipe to view additional details, such as a link to a YouTube video or an external website for the full recipe instructions.

- **Recipe Details**: Users can click on a recipe to view more information, including links to video tutorials or websites with full recipe instructions.
